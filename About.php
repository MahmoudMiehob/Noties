        <p class="About">
            Note-taking (sometimes written as notetaking or note taking) is the practice of
            recording information from different sources and platforms. By taking notes,
            the writer records the essence of the information, freeing their mind from
            having to recall everything.[1] Notes are commonly drawn from a transient source,
            such as an oral discussion at a meeting, or a lecture
           (notes of a meeting are usually called minutes), in which case the notes may be
            the only record of the event
